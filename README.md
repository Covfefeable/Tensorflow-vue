# 基于 vue 的 tensorflow.js 实验性工程

#### Note: to fully understand how the project works, basic javascript & mathmatic skills are required. For more details, read my [blog post](http://118.195.181.201/) here.

The project includes several math-based scenarios, intended to predict the result of math equations. By trainning machines with basic data, we can easily calculate (predict) the result of certain equation, or predict the future trend of stocks (experimental). Sounds fascinating, follow the following steps to get start! 


```shell

npm install

npm run dev

```

# todo:

#### ~~1.echarts code was scattered all over the projects, extract them into a public js file~~
#### 2.tensorflow-related code better be standardized, by using Layers API instead of Core API
