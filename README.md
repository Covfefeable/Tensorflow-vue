# 基于 vue 的 tensorflow.js 实验性工程

#### The project includes several math-based scenarios, intended to predict the result of elementary math equations. By trainning machines with basic data, we can easily calculate (predict) the result of certain equation, or predict the future trend of stocks. Sounds fascinating, follow the following steps to get start! 

```shell

npm install

npm run dev

```

# todo:

#### ~~1.echarts code was scattered all over the projects, extract them into a public js file~~
#### 2.tensorflow-related code should be standardized, by using ops instead of advanced apis
